# Different Conditional Simulation Techniques in Diffusion Models

This is the code repository for the experimental section of my master's dissertation `Different Conditional Simulation Techniques in Diffusion Models', completed in September 2023.

I conduct three main experiments, comparing the performance of three different conditioning techniques for simulation using diffusion models. The experiments cover simulation of a simple 2D dataset, a more complicated Bayesian inference problem, and finally small-scale image generation.

The code to run the experiments can be found in the notebooks folder, with relevant helper python files in the main directory. The final dissertation which combines the experimental results with an in depth discussion of theory is saved as 'Dissertation AMAD.pdf'.
